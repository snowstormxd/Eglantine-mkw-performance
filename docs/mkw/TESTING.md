# Mario Kart World Windows validation

Experimental Windows integration focused on MKW, **Fast GPU accuracy** and Vulkan.
The target system is the user's EPYC VM with 64 GiB RAM and an NVIDIA GPU reported
as a 5080 with 45 GiB VRAM. Use the driver's reported memory budget in the log and
the dedicated/shared memory CSV counters when evaluating this virtualized system.
It is built natively on Windows with upstream's UCRT64 clang PGO toolchain. The
profile is Eden's published `v020525` profile, not a newly trained MKW profile.

Launch **eglantine.exe** directly. Choose **Yes** in the recommended-settings popup
to use Vulkan, 1x, Fast, asynchronous shaders on, BC3, conservative VRAM, reactive
flushing off and FIFO Relaxed for MKW. These session settings override saved values
after per-game configuration loads, without rewriting saved preferences. **No**,
closing, or ignoring the popup keeps your own settings. The keys-install popup is
removed; manual installation remains available from Tools.

The supplied session log used a saved **2x** resolution override. The native
preset uses **1x for MKW when accepted**, with no launcher or environment variable needed.
Use the same effective 1x setting in the normal Eglantine comparison.
`MKW-Diagnostics.cmd` optionally enables the detailed GPU profiler; use it for
debugging, then return to the executable for timing. See
`PERFORMANCE-INVESTIGATION.md` for findings and the local recording benchmark.

Use **Switch 2 Multiplayer > Browse Rooms**, **Join Room**, or **Host Room** before
starting a game. Public rooms use Eden's existing directory, filtered to compatible
Switch 2 game IDs. Right-click a listed room to copy its ID. Public hosts can also
copy the ID from the connected-room window. Paste it into Join Room, or use a
server address and UDP port for an unlisted room. Public hosting needs an account
configured under Emulation > Configure > Web, plus an accessible UDP port.
The connection limit is 2-24; the game controls its own player limit.

This is for emulator players. Physical-console bridging and Nintendo Online are
not included. The native build and 90 automated cases pass, including loopback
broadcast/reply relay, password rejection and room capacity. Two-PC MKW gameplay
and the complete UI flow remain unverified.

The performance launcher now clears an inherited detailed-profiler environment
setting. The Vulkan startup log states whether the detailed GPU profiler is on.
For the 40–55 FPS follow-up, compare the same warm-cache route using the executable.
`record-memory.ps1` also records process CPU, busiest-thread CPU and the busiest
reported GPU engine. Blank GPU fields mean counters were unavailable; the first
row has no CPU delta. The GPU number is one engine's peak, not total GPU usage.

This follow-up starts at your existing Windows branch commit `0c2ecb55b1fc`.
See `WINDOWS-IMPROVEMENTS.md` for the inspected baseline and selected Zortos patches.

Check the new frontend behavior first: start with a deeply nested extracted-game
library, confirm the entry appears without enumerating RomFS assets, launch it,
and test close/stop/relaunch both while paused and while running. The size column
intentionally says **Not scanned** for loose dumps. F2 and Home+A must not open amiibo.
Keep `eden_log.txt` and `eden_log.txt.old.txt`, especially after a failed close.
Use `collect-debug.ps1 -MemoryCsv mkw-memory.csv` to gather a report after testing.

Extract the **whole** ZIP into a new directory and run `eglantine.exe`. Use a copy
of your existing configuration and saves. Do not change the game update, driver,
resolution or settings between the upstream and integration runs. Start with your
reported Fast configuration; leave GPU read tracking enabled. Frame generation
should be off while comparing real frame pacing. BC3 recompression is a useful
second comparison if you currently use uncompressed ASTC; record that setting.
The automatic BC3 threshold is raised to a driver-reported 20 GiB budget;
`EDEN_NX2_KEEP_ASTC=1` keeps uncompressed ASTC for a controlled comparison.

## Compare against the pinned upstream build

Base: `adae7635708e155d967e84d7ad84bf63c5203409`.

1. Use the same MKW version and run the same route/courses on each build for **at least 60
   minutes**. Include the course transitions and foliage where you saw corruption.
2. Record a first pass with an empty *copy* of the shader cache, then a warm-cache
   pass. Keep the original cache. Separating these distinguishes compilation
   hitches from continuing readback / texture-cache stalls.
3. At 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes record process private bytes, working set,
   dedicated/shared GPU memory, and frame-time percentiles if your existing
   capture tool provides them. Track the trend through repeated courses, not
   only peak FPS or the first race. `record-memory.ps1` automates memory sampling.
4. Check trees/foliage, drifting effects, collision, lighting, frame order and
   course transitions. Higher FPS with missing rendering is a failed result.
5. Keep the log, the CSV, the source commit in the ZIP, the game version and your
   actual driver-reported VRAM total. Do one Accurate-mode comparison on the same
   route if Fast still has missing objects. This distinguishes the Fast command
   path from shader/texture bugs that affect both modes.

## Controlled fallback comparisons

Change **one** variable at a time, then restart the emulator:

```powershell
$env:EDEN_NX2_COMMAND_POOL_RELEASE = '0' # original driver command-memory reuse
.\eglantine.exe
```

The new default releases recording memory every eight uses. For the previous
fork's every-reuse behavior, use `EDEN_NX2_COMMAND_POOL_RELEASE_INTERVAL=1`.
Remove these variables after the comparison.

`EDEN_NX2_UBOREUSE=0` disables small uniform allocation reuse.
`EDEN_NX2_PB_SNAPSHOT=0` disables submitted CPU command snapshots; GPU-written
command reads remain synchronized. Remove these variables for the default build.
Do not disable read traps as a performance test unless also checking correctness:
upstream issue #180 reports lost collision with that workaround.

## What the automated checks establish

- Standalone tests use the actual uniform reuse, GPU-written bitmap/range and
  buffer usage tracker headers, plus actual Ampere lowering with an FSEL/SEL reference interpreter. They cover mutation, scheduler/session reset,
  remapping, partial pages, integer overflow and 100,000 interval-oracle queries.
- The native Windows build compiles and links the GUI, packages Qt/plugins/DLLs,
  checks the AMD64 PE header and starts the packaged GUI without MSYS2 on PATH.
- A hosted Windows runner does **not** provide this NVIDIA GPU or the game.
  Its startup check is a loader/liveness check, not a successful game boot.

No 60-minute gameplay result or measured FPS improvement is claimed until tested
on the target machine. The integration does not implement full Ampere mesh/task
support. Upstream hardware emulation gaps may still cause missing graphics.

## Windows hybrid-timer test build

The 2 November timer build retains the previously tested flicker and fiber-memory
fixes. Longer HostTiming waits now release the CPU until shortly before their
deadline; short waits retain the precise path. The log should say
`Host timer: Windows high-resolution hybrid wait`.

Compare the same course and route with the previous final test build, using the
same copied shader cache and recommended settings. Check low FPS, hitches,
controller responsiveness, audio, item icons, and stopping/closing. A reduced
HostTiming CPU percentage alone is not a successful FPS comparison.

For a controlled fallback on this same executable, start a fresh process with
`EDEN_WINDOWS_TIMER_SPIN=1`. Remove the variable afterward. Unsupported timers
use the original wait automatically. No launcher script is needed for the default.
